## 📝 Introduction

Ekhoa is an open-source Chinese voice assistant based on Raspberry Pi 5. The system uses a fine-tuned qwen2.5-0.5B-Q8_0 model specifically optimized for legal case Q&A, intelligently identifies question types, and provides accurate answers. It supports offline speech recognition, speech synthesis, OLED screen real-time display. The modular design facilitates expansion and is suitable for home assistants, educational learning, and privacy-sensitive intelligent interaction scenarios.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎯 Intelligent Task Classification**: Automatically distinguishes between legal cases and general questions
- **🔒 Local-First**: Qwen2.5 model runs locally to protect privacy
- **🎤 Offline Speech**: SenseVoice speech recognition, no cloud required
- **📺 Visual Feedback**: OLED screen displays conversation content in real-time
- **🧩 Modular Design**: Each component can be independently replaced and upgraded

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi 5** with at least 8GB RAM
- **Microphone**: USB microphone supporting 16kHz sampling rate
- **Speaker or Headphone** for audio output
- **OLED Display** (optional, for visual feedback)
- **Power Supply**: Official Raspberry Pi 5 power supply recommended

## 💻 Software Dependencies

### System Dependencies
- **Python**: 3.13
- **Operating System**: Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit
- **Chinese Language Pack**: Required for Chinese speech recognition
- **Audio Drivers**: ALSA sound system

### Python Packages
All Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Key packages include:
- `pyaudio` for audio input/output
- `requests` for API communication
- `pillow` for OLED display
- `luma.oled` for OLED screen control

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Configure Chinese Environment

```bash
# 1. Open Raspberry Pi configuration tool
sudo raspi-config

# 2. Select "Localisation Options" -> "Locale"
# 3. Find "zh_CN.UTF-8 UTF-8" in the language list, select with spacebar
# 4. Press Enter to confirm, system will start configuring Chinese environment
# 5. Reboot Raspberry Pi after completion
sudo reboot

# 6. Install Chinese input method
sudo apt-get install -y fcitx-googlepinyin

# 7. Reboot again to activate input method
sudo reboot
```

### 2. Install System Dependencies and Python Packages

```bash
sudo apt install espeak espeak-ng python3-pyaudio libasound2-dev
    
# Activate virtual environment
source ~/your_venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. use llama.cpp

```bash

cd ~/ekhoa/llama.cpp/release/bin

./llama-server -m ~/your_model.gguf

```



#### Model Features

- **Fine-tuned for Legal Q&A**: Specially optimized for Chinese legal case questions
- **Local Execution**: Runs entirely on your Raspberry Pi, ensuring privacy
- **Low Resource Requirements**: Q8_0 quantization balances quality and performance
- **Smart Classification**: Automatically distinguishes between legal cases and general questions

#### How It Works

1. The system uses the fine-tuned qwen2.5-0.5B-Q8_0 model for all legal-related questions
2. General questions are handled by the standard Qwen2.5 model
3. The question classification happens automatically based on the content

**Note**: The fine-tuned model is included with the project and will be used automatically when legal questions are detected.

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Starting the Program

```bash
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt install espeak espeak-ng python3-pyaudio libasound2-dev

# Activate virtual environment
source ~/your_venv/bin/activate

# Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start SenseVoice API service (first start may automatically download model files)
cd ~/path/to/ekhoa/SenseVoice
python api.py
 
# Run main program
cd ~/path/to/ekhoa/code
python main.py
```

### Interaction Methods

1. After program starts, system service check will be performed
2. After check passes, voice assistant will prompt "Voice assistant startup complete, ready to serve you"
3. Speak directly into microphone to start conversation
4. Say wake words (default: "Assistant", "Hello", "Please", "Help") to trigger conversation

## ⚙️ Configuration

All configurations are in the `config.py` file. Main configuration parameters are as follows:

### AI Model Configuration
```python
AI_MODEL = "qwen2.5-0.5B-Q8_0"     # Local  model
OLLAMA_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/chat"  # llama.cpp service address
```

### Speech Recognition Configuration
```python
SENSEVOICE_API_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:7860/api/v1/asr"  # SenseVoice service address
SAMPLE_RATE = 16000       # Audio sampling rate
```

### OLED Display Configuration
```python
OLED_ENABLED = True                           # Whether to enable OLED display
OLED_WIDTH = 128                              # OLED screen width
OLED_HEIGHT = 64                              # OLED screen height
OLED_FONT_SIZE = 10                           # Font size (10px)
OLED_STARTUP_ANIMATION_DURATION = 2.0         # Startup animation duration (seconds)
OLED_SHOW_BORDER = False                      # Whether to show complete border
```

### 
## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### 1. No Audio Output

Create `.asoundrc` file in `/home/your_username/` directory to bind Raspberry Pi audio input and output.

```bash
sudo nano ~/.asoundrc
```

Input the following content (port number 2 is used here, device port numbers can be checked using `arecord -l` and `aplay -l`):

```
# Default playback device
pcm.!default {
    type plug
    slave {
        pcm "hw:2,0"
    }
}

# Default recording device
pcm.!dsnoop {
    type dsnoop
    ipc_key 1024
    slave {
        pcm "hw:2,0"
    }
}

# Default control device
ctl.!default {
    type hw
    card 2
}
```

### 2. Common Issues and Solutions

- **Microphone not detected**: Check USB connection and run `arecord -l` to verify
- **Speech recognition not working**: Ensure SenseVoice service is running on port 7860
- **OLED display not showing**: Check I2C connection and install `luma.oled` library
- **Ollama model not loading**: Verify Ollama service is running on port 11434

## 🧩 API Extensions

The project uses modular design, allowing easy replacement or extension:

- **ASR Module**: Replace with other speech recognition engines
- **TTS Module**: Replace with other speech synthesis engines  
- **AI Module**: Replace with other local AI models
- **Display Module**: Replace OLED with other display types
- **Wake Word Module**: Customize wake word detection logic
